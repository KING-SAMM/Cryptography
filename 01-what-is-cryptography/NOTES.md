WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY?
------------------------------------------
```
Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting information to prevent unauthorized access.

The decryptiion process should be known to both the sender and the receiver
```

HOW DOES CRYPTOGRAPHY WORK?
ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION?
------------------------------------------
```
Encryption is a primary route of employing cryptograohy by adding certain algorithms to jumble up the data.

Decryption is the process of reversing the work done by encrypting information so that the data becomes readable again

Both methods form the basis of cryptotgraphy
```

CIPHERS, PLAINTEXT AND CIPHERTEXT
------------------------------------------
```
Cipher      - An algorithm for encrypting data. It is a set of detailed steps to be carried out one after the other to make sure that the data becomes as unreadable as possible until it reaches the receiver.
Plaintext   - Data before encryption (or after decryption)
Ciphertext  - Data after encryption
Encryption Key  - Key used to scramble the data

```

APPLICATIONS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
------------------------------------------
```
1. SSL/TLS
2. Digital Signatures
3. Safe Online Banking
4. Secure Chatting Services
5. Encrypted Emails
6. Crypto-currency
```

TYPES OF ENCRYPTION IN CRYPTOGRAPHY
------------------------------------------
```
1. Symmetric Key Cryptography
2. Asymmetric Key Cryptography
```

APPLICATIONS OF SYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
------------------------------------------
```
1. Banking applications to authenticate ID and transctions
2. Server/Data Center information can be encrypted at rest
3. HTTPS encryption with secure all-around browsing
```
